			DATASTRUCTURES

The Main purpose is to implement all datastructures in
a way that is simple to understand. I choose the C Language
because it has no any internal implementation of these topics
in order to avoid abstraction by using a builing libraries(list) 
or language specific features such as classes in (OOP) languages.

HOW TO USE:
----------

1st: 
install gcc (for window users minGW),
most of Linux come with gcc installed by default.

2: download or clone this report (https://github.com/Chanoga/C_DataStructure.git)

3: cd (change directory) to the top you want to explore

4: compile your program e.g gcc -std=c11 binary_search.c -o binary_search

5: run your program ./binary_search
